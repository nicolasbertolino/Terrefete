# Terrefète

Terrefète showcases a house to rent located in the Pyrénées, France. Only a handful of information was needed to be displayed, thus the website is built around a single landing page with different sections for each aspect of the place.

## Features

The website is one big carousel with DOM elements being hidden until on the viewport. This allowed me to create interesting block animations on appear with keyframes.

## Assets

All photos were taken over the years and are the property of the owners of the website.

The texts are written with [Adobe Garamond](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/adobe-garamond), a very mature and classy font, perfect for depicting authenticity. The Terrefète logo is the result of the [Fave Script](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/fave) font, a scripted style typography which very smooth curves go as a reminder of the mountains and the easy life.
